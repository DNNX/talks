## If you’re referring to Apple’s desktop keyboards, the solution is much the same<br />as with Apple mice: you unplug the<br />Apple-provided piece of shit, throw it away, and plug in something that doesn’t suck.<br /><br />Actually, the keyboard, being small,<br />thin and light, is handy for dropping<br />onto the crash cart in a datacentre.<br />Partly because it’s easy to hold it in one’s teeth while half way up a ladder and swearing at a Linux box, and partly because it’s a piece of shit and therefore won’t go walkabouts.<br /><br />— Peter Corlett, [hates-software](http://hates-software.com)
