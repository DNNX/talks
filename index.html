      <dl>
        <dt>Teaching Ruby Basics | <a href='railsberry-2013'>slides</a></dt>
        <dd>A short lightning talk about lessons learned while teaching at Rails Girls Warsaw.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://railsberry.com'>Railsberry</a> 2013.</dd>

        <dt>Fly, You Tools! | <a href='rupy-2012'>slides</a></dt>
        <dd>As developers we heavily depend on our tools of the trade, as oftentimes mastering them means getting out of deep trouble so much faster.</dd>
        <dd>This talk covers some lesser known features of our everyday infrastructure – Git, PostgreSQL and command-line; tricks which make using these tools such a pleasure, regardless whether it’s for shaving yet another yak or saving one’s own skin.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://rupy.eu'>RuPy</a> 2012.</dd>

        <dt>Persist, Little Objects! | <a href='arrrrcamp-2012'>slides</a> | <a href='http://vimeo.com/album/2121090/video/51636332'>video</a></dt>
        <dd>Object persistence in Ruby is a&nbsp;tricky subject – everyone knows how to do it (‘simply use an ORM, plug it into a&nbsp;relational database and you’re done!’), most know the drawbacks (‘well, sure, you need to use a&nbsp;document database for the more schema-less cases… or serialise the variable parts… and, of course, object references need to be handled separately…’), but few experiment with alternatives.</dd>
        <dd>This talk, after recalling the popular database-driven persistence solutions, concentrates on the less known, but more interesting and often quite useful approaches – from file-based PStore (ideal for small apps), through Candy’s out-of-the-way magic, to MagLev’s true cross-process transparent object persistence.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://arrrrcamp.be'>Arrrrcamp</a> 2012.</dd>

        <dt>Ruby on the Command-Line | <a href='eurucamp-2012'>slides</a></dt>
        <dd>Ruby, thanks to its various frameworks, is known to be the language for web applications – and recent developments in graphic libraries make it a&nbsp;worthy contestant in the world of GUI-driven desktop programs. But Ruby is also great for writing command-line applications; the ability to mix no-boilerplate top-level functions with full-fledged OOP means its usage can vary from one-off trivial scripts to complicated, option-heavy command-line powerhouses.</dd>
        <dd>This talk presents the nits and bolts of writing a&nbsp;command-line application with Ruby – from option parsing and accessing standard input/output to playing nice with POSIX standards like exit codes and signal/interrupt handling.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://eurucamp.org'>eurucamp</a> 2012.</dd>

        <dt>PStore: stdlib’s Persistence</dt>
        <dd>PStore is a&nbsp;greatly underappreciated (and vastly uknown) simple persistence library shipped with Ruby. This talk covers it’s vices and virtues, along with real-life usage example in a&nbsp;pet project.</dd>
        <dd><a href='wrug-2012-08'>Preview</a> (a lightning talk) from <a href='http://wrug.eu'>Warsaw Ruby Users Group</a>, August 2012.</dd>

        <dt>From Here to Eternity | <a href='lightningio-2012'>slides</a></dt>
        <dd>A 42-slide, five minute lightining talk on the interactions between Ruby’s <code>Date</code> class and <code>Enumerable</code> module.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://lightning.io'>Lightning IO</a> 2012.</dd>

        <dt>Decoupling Persistence (Like There’s Some Tomorrow) | <a href='src-2012'>slides</a> | <a href='http://programme.scottishrubyconference.com/proposals/70/video'>video</a></dt>
        <dd><cite>When I&nbsp;open up a&nbsp;Rails project and the models dir is full of 100% ActiveRecord classes I&nbsp;shudder. Model ≠ Persistence.</cite> — Ben Mabey</dd>
        <dd>From DCI to presenters, from Uncle Bob’s <a href='http://confreaks.com/videos/759'>architecture talk</a> and Avdi Grimm’s <cite><a href='http://objectsonrails.com'>Objects on Rails</a></cite> book to the proliferation of (competing? complementing?) database systems, it seems the time has come to seriously consider decoupling our objects’ persistence from the rest of the application.</dd>
        <dd>This talk – after describing the general vices of strong object/database coupling and the all-too-usual <code>rails&nbsp;g&nbsp;model</code>-driven development – covers the various approaches to separating the objects’ persistence layer, along with their virtues (cleaner, simpler tests! backend independence! no RDBMS-related shortcuts impacting the design!) and potential vices (performance? perceived compexity? YAGNI?).</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://wrocloverb.com'>wroc_love.rb</a> 2012 and <a href='http://scottishrubyconference.com'>Scottish Ruby Conference</a> 2012.</dd>

        <dt>C-C-C-Combo Maker</dt>
        <dd>Ruby is a&nbsp;wonderful high-level lanuguage for expressing ideas and algorithms, but even after rewriting it umpteen times the most sophisticated algorithm can be a&nbsp;CPU-bound bottleneck. Similarly, accessing (especially custom) system devices straight from Ruby is usually doable, but easier via the provided C&nbsp;drivers.</dd>
        <dd>This talk, based on experience with algorithm optimisation and custom device drivers gained when working at the Warsaw University of Technology, shows how easy it is to marry Ruby and C&nbsp;– from writing MRI-targeting C&nbsp;extensions, through building a&nbsp;proper FFI-oriented wrapper, to rewriting crucial – and yet, slow – parts of your codebase in C&nbsp;using RubyInline, without leaving the Ruby method.</dd>
        <dd><a href='wrug-2012-06'>Preview</a> (a lightning talk) from <a href='http://wrug.eu'>Warsaw Ruby Users Group</a>, June 2012.</dd>

        <dt>Persisting Relations Across Time and Space | <a href='rubyconf-2011'>slides</a> | <a href='http://confreaks.net/videos/657'>video</a></dt>
        <dd>Entities and their relations are the backbone of most Ruby applications – from trivial, one-off command-line utilities to full-blown social network websites. The good old relational databases, while showing extreme abilities in both adaptation and survival, are no longer the obvious choice for persistence – and sometimes obviously not an ideal one.</dd>
        <dd>This talk discusses various entity/relation modeling approaches and different persistence techniques – from rigid schemas in suits to collections of hippie free-form documents; from good old (transactional!) PStore through join-table-happy RDBMS-es and muscle-flexing NoSQL hools to (social!) graph databases, waiting patiently for broader recognition and prime time.</dd>
        <dd>Quite a&nbsp;few interesting Ruby libraries for gluing all this together are also pondered upon – from world-class champions like Active Record and ARel to less known gems like Candy and Ambition.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://rubyconf.org'>RubyConf</a> 2011.</dd>

        <dt>From Profiling Ruby to Frankenstein Programming  | <a href='src-2011'>slides</a> | <a href='http://confreaks.net/videos/547'>video</a></dt>
        <dd>Ruby is ‘known to be slow’ – but what does that exactly mean, does it really matter, and – more importantly – what can we do about this?</dd>
        <dd>This presentation, based on hands-on experience of using Ruby for scientific computations, shows how to profile Ruby applications (including webapps), how to interpret the results and what to do with the bottlenecks – from algorithmic optimisation through using dedicated libraries to rewriting them (in place!) in ‘faster’ languages.</dd>
        <dd>Given at <a href='http://euruko.org'>EuRuKo</a> 2010, <a href='http://rubyandrails.eu'>Ruby and Rails</a> 2010 and <a href='http://scottishrubyconference.com'>Scottish Ruby Conference</a> 2011.</dd>

        <dt>Standard Library, Uncommon Uses | (proposal)</dt>
        <dd>There are tonnes of little- or virtually unknown libraries in Ruby’s stdlib, and they found their way there for a reason. Much like revisiting `Enumerable`’s method list times and again makes you a better Ruby programmer, so does looking into its standard library – not only because there are things you didn’t know existed, but also because the way the’re implemented is often quite enlightening.</dd>
        <dd>This talk shows some of the useful, clever and tricky uses of Ruby’s standard library – like GServer, DRb/Rinda, PStore, Ripper and SecureRandom – that do not require the installation of any gems and can be used in any environment hosting a Ruby implementation. Did you ever want to write your own server, do some distributed computing, don’t worry about persistence? It’s all there; come and see for yourself!</dd>

        <dt>Going Clean and Simple with minitest/spec | (proposal)</dt>
        <dd>The Ruby community is known for praising well-tested code, with a&nbsp;lot of projects being developed in a&nbsp;test- (or spec-) driven fashion. minitest/spec is a&nbsp;simple and minimalistic DSL for behaviour specification and behaviour-driven development, gaining popularity ever since being a&nbsp;part of Ruby 1.9 standard library.</dd>
        <dd>This talk presents minitest/spec’s virtues and vices, the benefits and drawbacks of mocking with minitest/mock, as well as the interesting world of asserting algorithmic performance with minitest/benchmark.</dd>
