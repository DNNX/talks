## number of pairs

* binominal coefficient
* number of ‘choose k from n’ combinations
* n! ÷ (k! × (n-k)!)
* k = 2
* n! ÷ (2! × (n-2)!) = n × (n-1) ÷ 2
* let’s assume 2245 authors
* 2245 × 2244 ÷ 2 = 2,518,890 pairs
* (that’s `2_518_890` in Ruby)

## let’s distribute!

* <span class='quote'>So Google has the 4.3.2.0/24 IP allocation and they’re not using a single address. I’d give 4.3.2.1 to NASA for rocket launch livestreams.<br />— Jonty Wareing</span>
* let’s assume that we have the 1.2.3.0/26 subnet
* that’s 62 addresses
* how can we run services on them?
